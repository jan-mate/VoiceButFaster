## Development

If you want to help check the label [PR-Welcome](https://github.com/PaulWoitaschek/Voice/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22PR+welcome%22).
Its always a good idea to talk about what are going to do before you actually start it, so frustration can be avoided.

Some rules for coding:
* Use the code style the project uses
* For each feature, make a separate branch, so it can be reviewed separately
* Use commits with a good description, so everyone can see what you did

## <a name="trans">Translations</a>
The project page is on [weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/engage/voice/). There all the localizations are maintained. If you want to contribute, check if there are untranslated or wrong translated words.

Or you can start translating a new language if you speak it ;-)
